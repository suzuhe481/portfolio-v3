# Hector Suazo's Portfolio

This is the 3rd remake of my portfolio website. While my previous portfolio was solely a frontend React app, this version is a full-stack NExt.js app, with a backend that connects to a database.

With the backend, I plan to store most of the website's data in the database. This will include simple data like text, and it will also allow me to store images in a separate service and fetch those images through my backend. This will keep my frontend focused on rendering and presenting data.
