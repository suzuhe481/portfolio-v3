# Hector Suazo's Portfolio v3

## [Link to Portfolio](https://www.hectorsuazo.com/)

This is my 3rd portfolio website. While my previous portfolio was solely a frontend React app, this version is a full-stack Next.js app, with a backend that connects to a Supabase database.

The database is used to store image urls and their metadata. My images are stored separately in an AWS S3 bucket, so storing and fetching the urls allows me to include many more images than if I just included the images in the frontend.

I used a lot of technologies in building this. Some familiar, and some I've never used before. I enjoyed learning how these new ones work and incorporating them with what I know to make my portfolio feel more interactive than my previous one.
